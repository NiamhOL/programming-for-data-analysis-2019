**Task**
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. This required 
required the ceration of a Jupyter notebook to exaplain the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

**Getting started**

Download and install Python and Anaconda

**Packages used in this project**

The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and draw grpahs for this project.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text.

**Importing packages**

The above packages can be imported into Python. Use Import function in iPython as follows:

    'import ipython'
    'import numpy as np'
    'import jupyter notebook'
